inJS
    The definition of mixins can be stated as mixins is a class that contains methods.
that can be used by other classes without inheriting from that class
----------------------------------------------------------------
inTS

Mixins are a faux-multiple inheritance pattern for classes in JavaScript which TypeScript has support for. 
The pattern allows you to create a class which is a merge of many classes. To get started, we need a type 
which we'll use to extend other classes from reusable components is to build them by combining simpler partial classes

Mixins are special classes that contain a combination of methods that can be used by other classes. Mixins promote code reusability and help you avoid limitations associated with multiple inheritance
----------------------------------------------------------------
JS and TS only support single inhertance so can't

Mixins
    In javascript, we can only inherit from a single object. there can be only one [Prototype] for an object. 
and a class may Extend only one other class.
     a mixin is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it.
    Js not support multiple -  inhertance by default  but some time we need mix of multiple objects used by other class with out inheritance from that class
method mixins provide certain behavior which is not used alone but can be used to add these behaviors to other classes.


--------------
TS documentation
    popular way of building up classes from reusable components is to build them by combining simpler partial classes.
    TypeScriptâ€™s best mixin support is done via the class expression pattern
